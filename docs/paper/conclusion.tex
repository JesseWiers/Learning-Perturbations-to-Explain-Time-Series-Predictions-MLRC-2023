\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented in this study \texttt{\detokenize{time_interpret}} an extension of Captum with a specific focus on
time series, along with several novel attribution methods.
This repository also comes with a number of experiments, using methods implemented in this library.
We did not report the results of these experiments in this paper, but the reader can refer to them in the relevant
sections of the codebase.
We hope that this work will foster further research in the field of explainable AI applied to time series.
