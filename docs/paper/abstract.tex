We introduce \texttt{\detokenize{time_interpret}}, a library designed as an extension of
captum~\citep{kokhlikyan2020captum}, with a specific focus on temporal data and models.
As such, this library implements several feature attribution methods that can be used to explain predictions made by
any Pytorch~\citep{NEURIPS2019_9015} model.
\texttt{\detokenize{time_interpret}} also provides several synthetic and real world time series data, various PyTorch
models, as well as a set of methods to evaluate feature attributions.
Moreover, while being primarily developed to explain predictions based on temporal data, some of its components have a
different application, including for instance methods explaining predictions made by language models.
In this paper, we give a general introduction of this library.
We also present several previously unpublished feature attribution methods, which have been developed along with
\texttt{\detokenize{time_interpret}}.
